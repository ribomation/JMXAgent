This is a small bit of code that will start Introscope monitoring of JMX metrics for any app running in a 1.5 JVM.

Requirements:
- JVM 1.5
- Introscope Agent installed in application
- Application has an existing JMX Agent (MBean Server)

Installation:
- Drop this JAR file into the same directory as the Introscope Agent's WebAppSupport.jar

Configuration:
- Add this line to the application's startup configuration command line
    -javaagent:/path/to/JMXAgent.jar

If the Introscope Agent is started using -javaagent then make sure that it is before the -javaagent that starts the JMXAgent.
For example:
    java -javaagent:Agent.jar -javaagent:JMXAgent.jar -jar MyApplication.jar
