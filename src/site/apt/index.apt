JMX Agent

    This is a small connector to kick-start the JMX machinery of a CA-Wily Introscope Agent.

Requirements

    This Java library is an agent-side plug-in for CA-Wily Introscope. Introscope is a commercial tool for
    application performance management (APM) of (large) Java applications in production. In order to use
    and/or compile this library you need to have a valid Introscope license. For compilation, a valid Agent.jar
    file is required as well. You will need to manually install this JAR file into your local Maven cache,
    using the instructions in the POM file of this project.

    This library has been developed and tested using Introscope version 8.

    * Java 5+

    * Introscope Agent installed in application

    * Application has an existing JMX Agent (MBean Server)

Installation

    Drop this JAR file into the same directory as the Introscope Agent's WebAppSupport.jar

Configuration

    Add this line to the application's startup configuration command line

+----
    -javaagent:/path/to/JMXAgent.jar
+----

    If the Introscope Agent is started using -javaagent then make sure that it is before the -javaagent that starts the JMXAgent.
    For example:

+----
    java -javaagent:Agent.jar -javaagent:JMXAgent.jar -jar MyApplication.jar
+----
